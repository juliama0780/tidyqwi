# tidyqwi

The goal of tidyqwi is to make accessing the US Census Bureau's Quarterly Workforce Indicators Easier in a tidy format. This is a work in progress!

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("medewitt/tidyqi")
```

After installation you can load and retrieve the desired data!

```{r}
library(tidyqwi)

output <- get_qwi(years = "2010", states = "37", apikey = censuskey)

```

And look at your data:

```{r}
head(output)
```

And there are labels added

```{r}
Hmisc::describe(output)
```
